Navigate to https://project-group-b.github.io/BehavioralEnrichment-Angular/ to view the documentation pages.\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\nDeployment\n1) Use '$git clone __your_github_repo_url'\n2) $cd _new_directory_created_by_git_clone\n3) $npm install\n4) $npm install -g @angular/cli\n5) $npm install --save-dev --unsafe-perm node-sass (sass module needs fixed every time)\n6) Follow prompts to conduct an npm audit\n7) $ng build\n8) $cp ~/BehavioralEnrichment-Angular/dist /var/www/html (copies to nginx, install directions\nhere: https://arjunphp.com/deploy-angular-app-production-nginx/)\n9) Edit /etc/nginx/ so it contains the files in the Nginx Config Files on the PGB-Java Repository.\n10) Ensure 'baseUrl' in \"global.ts\" matches the front facing deployment address, and is using port 8080, as below:\nreadonly baseUrl = 'http://ec2-3-84-52-67.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080';\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n
